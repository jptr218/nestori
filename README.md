### Nestori is a tool that uses [DNS Cache Poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing) to maliciously update records in the DNS server of your choice, as long as the server has incremental transaction IDs.
## Nestori can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jptr218/nestori/raw/main/nestori.exe) (you will need to run it from the command line)
### Usage:

### `Nestori [target DNS] [target domain] [domain's NS] [IP of domain's NS] [new destination]`
