### Nestori is a tool that uses [DNS Cache Poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing) to change cached records in Google's DNS server, making them point to a malicious host of your choice.
## Nestori can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jptr218/nestori/raw/main/nestori.exe) (you will need to run it from the command line)
### Usage:

### `Nestori [target domain] [domain's NS] [IP of domain's NS] [new destination]`
